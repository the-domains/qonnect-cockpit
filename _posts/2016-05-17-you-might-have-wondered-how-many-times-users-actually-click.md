description: 'You might have wondered how many times users actually click on a call to action in qNews. Until now, you could only use URL-shortening tools to get this kind of information. Using URL-shortener is quite cumbersome: copy link, open URL-shortener and create short-link, copy short-link, open connect cockpit and paste short-link into the call to action field. Now, this works without the detour of external URL-shorteners: just copy the link into the call to action field and we take care of the rest. The number of clicks is displayed next the the likes/favorites in the corresponding qNews. As bonus, you’ll get the information how many of your customers are Android users and how many use iPhones. This is so cool, isn’t is :-)?'
